# Friend List App

First time trying rails and this is my first project. Rails is super fast and easy to use.

Creating CRUD and user session in no time. I am using scaffold for the CRUD and devise for the user management. Moreover, I learn about association in this project too. Pretty confused because I just type a few lines of codes and then all was setted up by the rails. Magnificent!
